Save these files and name them 'apple-touch-icon-152x152-precomposed.png' and 'apple-touch-icon-120x120-precomposed.png' respectively, then upload them to your webspace in the root directory of your website. Now insert the following code in the head area of your website:
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="120x120" href="/apple-touch-icon-120x120-precomposed.png" /> <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="152x152" href="/apple-touch-icon-152x152-precomposed.png" />
