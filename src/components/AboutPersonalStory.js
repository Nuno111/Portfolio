        Personal Story
      </h3>
      <p>
        Born and raised in a seaside town called Vila Real
        de Santo Ant√≥nio on the south coast of Portugal, a
        beautiful country with lovely weather and great
        quality of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I left Portugal in 2015 and moved to the UK where I
        lived for about 5 years. Before this decision, I was
        stuck working part-time jobs in the catering
        industry during the summer months and unemployed
        after that since work is scarce in the Algarve
        region after the summer months.

      <p>
        I can safely say this was the best decision I've
        ever made because moving away to another country
        alone with just enough money to survive one or two
        months and no job lined up made me who I am today.
      </p>
      <p>
        I faced challenges I would never have had if I had
        stayed close to home and learned how to fight for
        myself and my objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving away from everything I always took for
        granted also gave me a different perspective on
        everything I have and taught me to appreciate it
        more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I moved back to Portugal in 2021 to pursue my career
        as a web developer and be closer to my friends and
        family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since most of my days are spent sitting at a desk, I
        like to have hobbies that involve exercise. I go to
        the gym 3/4 weeks a week and try to cycle everywhere
        I can. I also enjoy other sport such as tennis and
        bouldering. On the other hand, I'm also a gamer so
        if there's a new game out I desperately want to play
        then I won't be moving much at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever I go on holiday I try to go to sunny places
        and explore around. My favourite trips so far have
        been to the Philippines and Sri Lanka, where I spent
        2/3 weeks travelling around the country and meeting
        the locals, never staying in the same place for more
        than a few days.
